# 部署kubeadm

These instructions are for Kubernetes v1.30.

1. Update the apt package index and install packages needed to use the Kubernetes apt repository:

   ```shell
   sudo apt-get update
   # apt-transport-https may be a dummy package; if so, you can skip that package
   sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gpg
   ```

2. Download the public signing key for the Kubernetes package repositories. The same signing key is used for all repositories so you can disregard the version in the URL:

   ```shell
   # If the directory `/etc/apt/keyrings` does not exist, it should be created before the curl command, read the note below.
   # sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings
   curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
   ```

   > Note:
   >
   > In releases older than Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22.04, directory /etc/apt/keyrings does not exist by default, and it should be created before the curl command.

3. Add the appropriate Kubernetes apt repository. Please note that this repository have packages only for Kubernetes 1.30; for other Kubernetes minor versions, you need to change the Kubernetes minor version in the URL to match your desired minor version (you should also check that you are reading the documentation for the version of Kubernetes that you plan to install).

   ```shell
   # This overwrites any existing configuration in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
   echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
   ```

4. Update the apt package index, install kubelet, kubeadm and kubectl, and pin their version:

   ```shell
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
   sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
   ```

5. (Optional) Enable the kubelet service before running kubeadm:

   ```shell
   sudo systemctl enable --now kubelet
   The kubelet is now restarting every few seconds, as it waits in a crashloop for kubeadm to tell it what to do
   ```
